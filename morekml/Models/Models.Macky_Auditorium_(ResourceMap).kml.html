<p>KML 2.2 introduced <code>ResourceMap</code> (textures.txt is deprecated)</p>
<p>The .dae file texture file names are "../files/foo.jpg"
each of which is stored in textures/foo.jpg in the file system.</p>
<p><code>targetHref</code> references are relative to the .dae (not this .kml) hence the textures/foo.jpg.</p>
